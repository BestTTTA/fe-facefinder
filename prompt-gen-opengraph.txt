Create an OpenGraph image for a Next.js app titled "Where My Photos".
The image should feature:

Many people’s faces from various events (diverse settings like parties, sport, trips).

A collage or grid of these images to show variety.

A visual element that suggests AI is searching or detecting faces (e.g., facial recognition bounding boxes or scanning effect).

No app or generic icons — focus on the people, photos, and AI search theme.
